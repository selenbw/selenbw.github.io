I am currently a senior data scientist/biostatistician at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/) and research associate at the [Veteran Affairs Center for Innovation to Implementation (Ci2i)](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/centers/ci2i.cfm). 

Previously I managed the Quantitative Science team in the Machine Learning group of [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/) and was a research scientist in the [Center of Biomedical Informatics and Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford](https://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html). 

I completed my Ph.D. research in clinical natural language processing and machine learning under direction of [Prof. Daniel L. Rubin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-rubin) and Prof. Kemal Hakan Gulkesen at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/) and [Akdeniz University.](https://eng.akdeniz.edu.tr/)
