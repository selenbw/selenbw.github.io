My research interests center around the development, evaluation, and implementation of patient-centered artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that advance the quality and equity of healthcare delivery. Leveraging expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, and biostatistics, I seek to explore the ethical implications of AI in healthcare decision-making, ensuring that machine learning is both reliable and statistically rigorous, while remaining human-compatible. Additionally, I am committed to contributing to broader AI governance efforts, shaping policies that support the ethical and equitable use of AI in healthcare.

Starting September 2023, I will join [Emory University's Biomedical Informatics Department]((https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html)) as an Assistant Professor and [AI Humanity Initiative](https://aihumanity.emory.edu/) Scholar. Currently, I hold the position of Senior Data Scientist/Biostatistician at Stanford University, and I am also a Research Associate at the Veteran Affairs Center for Innovation to Implementation (Ci2i).
