My research interests center around the development, evaluation, and implementation of patient-centered artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that reduce the burden of healthcare delivery, promote health equity, and ultimately improve health outcomes. Leveraging my expertise in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and biostatistics, I seek to explore the entire patient journey to uncover hidden data and signals from patient-doctor communication. I am committed to contributing to broader AI governance efforts, shaping policies that support the ethical and equitable use of AI in healthcare. 

Starting September 2023, I will join [Emory University's Biomedical Informatics Department]((https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html)) as an Assistant Professor and [AI Humanity Initiative](https://aihumanity.emory.edu/) Scholar. Currently, I hold the position of Senior Data Scientist/Biostatistician at Stanford University, and I am also a Research Associate at the Veteran Affairs Center for Innovation to Implementation (Ci2i).
